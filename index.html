            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">A balanced diet is a diet that contains differing kinds of foods in certain quantities and proportions so that the requirement for calories, proteins, minerals, vitamins and alternative nutrients is adequate and a small provision is reserved for additional nutrients to endure the short length of leanness. In addition, a balanced diet ought to offer bioactive phytochemicals like dietary fiber, antioxidants and nutraceuticals that have positive health advantages. A balanced diet should offer around 60-70% of total calories from carbohydrates, 10-12% from proteins and 20-25% of total calories from fat.</p>

            <h4>Junk Food</h4>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
            <p>Its the 21st century and junk food has gone global. For better or for worse (mostly worse), junk food is now available all over the world. We see it most everywhere we go -- in grocery and convenience stores, fast-food restaurants, on television -- usually looking very appealing. But just what are the facts about junk food?

                Junk food generally refers to foods that contribute lots of calories but little nutritional value. Of course, whats considered junk food depends on whom you ask. Some might say pizza is junk food, for example. But I personally do not think so, since it contributes real food with nutrients, like cheese and tomato sauce. Add whole-wheat or part whole-wheat crust, plus veggies as a topping, and I would say pizza completely exits the junk food category.

                One problem with junk foods is that they are low in satiation value -- that is, people do not tend to feel as full when they eat them -- which can lead to overeating. Another problem is that junk food tends to replace other, more nutritious foods. When people drink lots of soda, for example, they are usually not getting plenty of low-fat dairy or other healthful beverages like green tea or orange juice. When they are snacking on chips and cookies, they are usually not loading up on fruits and vegetables.</p>
